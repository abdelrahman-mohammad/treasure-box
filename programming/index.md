# Basic patterns of algorithms

## List of basic patterns of algorithms that are used in programming.
Patterns of Algorithms that transform a sequence of values into a single value (reduction).
- [Counting](/programming/single.md#counting)
- [Maximum selection](/programming/single.md#maximum-selection)
- [Selection](/programming/single.md#selection)
- [Decision](/programming/single.md#decision)
- [Search](/programming/single.md#search)
