# Diagonalization of matrices

## Introduction
Matrix diagonalization is the process of taking a square matrix and converting it into a special type of matrix--a so-called diagonal matrix--that shares the same fundamental properties of the underlying matrix. The diagonal matrix is a matrix where all the elements are zero except for the elements along the diagonal. The diagonal matrix is a special case of a triangular matrix, which is a matrix where all the elements above or below the diagonal are zero. The diagonal matrix is also a special case of a symmetric matrix, which is a matrix where the elements above the diagonal are the same as the elements below the diagonal.
