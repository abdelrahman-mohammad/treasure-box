# Math topics<br>for test preparation
The materials intent to cover complicated math topics that you are expected to know and understand before certain tests.

**Work in progress!**
## Math topics for Test #2
- [Inverse of matrices](/basicmath/inverse-mx.md)

## Math topics for Test #3
- [Inverse of matrices using Gauss-Jordan elimination](/basicmath/inverse-mx-gj.md)
- [Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](/basicmath/eigen.md)
