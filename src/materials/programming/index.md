# Basic patterns of algorithms

## List of basic patterns of algorithms that are used in programming.

Patterns of Algorithms that transform a sequence of values into a single value (reduction).

- [Counting](/materials/programming/single.md#counting)
- [Maximum selection](/materials/programming/single.md#maximum-selection)
- [Selection](/materials/programming/single.md#selection)
- [Decision](/materials/programming/single.md#decision)
- [Search](/materials/programming/single.md#search)
- [Sequence calculation](/materials/programming/single.md#sequence-calculation)

Patterns of Algorithms that transform a sequence of values into another sequence of values.

- [Copy](/materials/programming/sequence.md#copy)
- [Multiple item selection (MIS)](/materials/programming/sequence.md#multiple-item-selection-mis)
