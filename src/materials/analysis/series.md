# Determining sum of series

## Infinite series

An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series. If the sequence of partial sums converges to a limit, the series is said to be convergent. If the sequence of partial sums does not converge, the series is said to be divergent.

For $(a_n): \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, the series is denoted as:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots
$$

#### N-th partial sum of a series

The n-th partial sum of a series is the sum of the first n terms of the series:

$$
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
$$

#### Sum of an infinite series

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
$$
