# Invertable functions

Most of the material for this topic was covered in previous semester's basic mathematics course. We will only briefly review the concept of invertible functions and their properties.

## Determining invertability

Function $f(x)$ is invertible if it is one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). This means that for every $y$ in the codomain of $f$, there is exactly one $x$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f(x) = y$.
