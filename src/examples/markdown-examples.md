# Markdown Extension Examples

This page demonstrates some of the built-in markdown extensions provided by VitePress.

## Syntax Highlighting

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji), with additional features like line-highlighting:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

**Input**

````md
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
